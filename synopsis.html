                    Seeking to restore humanity’s diminishing hope, the Survey Corps embark on a mission to retake Wall
                    Maria, where the battle against the merciless "Titans" takes the stage once again.

                    Returning to the tattered Shiganshina District that was once his home, Eren Yeager and the Corps
                    find the town oddly unoccupied by Titans. Even after the outer gate is plugged, they strangely
                    encounter no opposition. The mission progresses smoothly until Armin Arlert, highly suspicious of
                    the enemy's absence, discovers distressing signs of a potential scheme against them.

                    Shingeki no Kyojin Season 3 Part 2 follows Eren as he vows to take back everything that was once
                    his. Alongside him, the Survey Corps strive—through countless sacrifices—to carve a path towards
                    victory and uncover the secrets locked away in the Yeager family's basement.

                <p class=" text-small">
                    A shinigami, as a god of death, can kill any person—provided they see their victim's face and write
                    their victim's name in a notebook called a Death Note. One day, Ryuk, bored by the shinigami
                    lifestyle and interested in seeing how a human would use a Death Note, drops one into the human
                    realm.

                    High school student and prodigy Light Yagami stumbles upon the Death Note and—since he deplores the
                    state of the world—tests the deadly notebook by writing a criminal's name in it. When the criminal
                    dies immediately following his experiment with the Death Note, Light is greatly surprised and
                    quickly recognizes how devastating the power that has fallen into his hands could be.

                    With this divine capability, Light decides to extinguish all criminals in order to build a new world
                    where crime does not exist and people worship him as a god. Police, however, quickly discover that a
                    serial killer is targeting criminals and, consequently, try to apprehend the culprit. To do this,
                    the Japanese investigators count on the assistance of the best detective in the world: a young and
                    eccentric man known only by the name of L.

                    The self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe rents out a room in a rickety old building in
                    Akihabara, where he indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective "future gadgets" with
                    fellow lab members: Mayuri Shiina, his air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, a perverted
                    hacker nicknamed "Daru." The three pass the time by tinkering with their most promising contraption
                    yet, a machine dubbed the "Phone Microwave," which performs the strange function of morphing bananas
                    into piles of green gel.

                    Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's search for
                    a scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a string of
                    mysterious happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected success—the Phone Microwave can send
                    emails to the past, altering the flow of history.

                    Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes Okabe
                    through the depths of scientific theory and practicality. Forced across the diverging threads of
                    past and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with holding the key to the realm of
                    time.

                    Hunter x Hunter is set in a world where Hunters exist to perform all manner of dangerous tasks like
                    capturing criminals and bravely searching for lost treasures in uncharted territories.
                    Twelve-year-old Gon Freecss is determined to become the best Hunter possible in hopes of finding his
                    father, who was a Hunter himself and had long ago abandoned his young son. However, Gon soon
                    realizes the path to achieving his goals is far more challenging than he could have ever imagined.

                    Along the way to becoming an official Hunter, Gon befriends the lively doctor-in-training Leorio,
                    vengeful Kurapika, and rebellious ex-assassin Killua. To attain their own goals and desires,
                    together the four of them take the Hunter Exam, notorious for its low success rate and high
                    probability of death. Throughout their journey, Gon and his friends embark on an adventure that puts
                    them through many hardships and struggles. They will meet a plethora of monsters, creatures, and
                    characters—all while learning what being a Hunter truly means.

                    It has been two and a half years since Naruto Uzumaki left Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village,
                    for intense training following events which fueled his desire to be stronger. Now Akatsuki, the
                    mysterious organization of elite rogue ninja, is closing in on their grand plan which may threaten
                    the safety of the entire shinobi world.

                    Although Naruto is older and sinister events loom on the horizon, he has changed little in
                    personality—still rambunctious and childish—though he is now far more confident and possesses an
                    even greater determination to protect his friends and home. Come whatever may, Naruto will carry on
                    with the fight for what is important to him, even at the expense of his own body, in the
                    continuation of the saga about the boy who wishes to become Hokage.

                    After five years of harboring unspoken feelings, high-schooler Taiju Ooki is finally ready to
                    confess his love to Yuzuriha Ogawa. Just when Taiju begins his confession however, a blinding green
                    light strikes the Earth and petrifies mankind around the world—turning every single human into
                    stone.

                    Several millennia later, Taiju awakens to find the modern world completely nonexistent, as nature
                    has flourished in the years humanity stood still. Among a stone world of statues, Taiju encounters
                    one other living human: his science-loving friend Senkuu, who has been active for a few months.
                    Taiju learns that Senkuu has developed a grand scheme—to launch the complete revival of civilization
                    with science. Taiju's brawn and Senkuu's brains combine to forge a formidable partnership, and they
                    soon uncover a method to revive those petrified.

                    However, Senkuu's master plan is threatened when his ideologies are challenged by those who awaken.
                    All the while, the reason for mankind's petrification remains unknown.

                    Gol D. Roger was known as the "Pirate King," the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed
                    the Grand Line. The capture and execution of Roger by the World Government brought a change
                    throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the existence of the greatest
                    treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of
                    Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece—which promises an unlimited amount of riches and
                    fame—and quite possibly the pinnacle of glory and the title of the Pirate King.

                    Enter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy who defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather
                    than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate ransacking villages for fun,
                    Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder: the thought of an exciting adventure that
                    leads him to intriguing people and ultimately, the promised treasure. Following in the footsteps of
                    his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures,
                    unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach the most coveted of all
                    fortunes—One Piece.

                    Kamado's shoulders. Though living impoverished on a remote mountain, the Kamado family are able to
                    enjoy a relatively peaceful and happy life. One day, Tanjirou decides to go down to the local
                    village to make a little money selling charcoal. On his way back, night falls, forcing Tanjirou to
                    take shelter in the house of a strange man, who warns him of the existence of flesh-eating demons
                    that lurk in the woods at night.

                    When he finally arrives back home the next day, he is met with a horrifying sight—his whole family
                    has been slaughtered. Worse still, the sole survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been turned into
                    a bloodthirsty demon. Consumed by rage and hatred, Tanjirou swears to avenge his family and stay by

                    The seemingly ordinary and unimpressive Saitama has a rather unique hobby: being a hero. In order to
                    pursue his childhood dream, he trained relentlessly for three years—and lost all of his hair in the
                    process. Now, Saitama is incredibly powerful, so much so that no enemy is able to defeat him in
                    battle. In fact, all it takes to defeat evildoers with just one punch has led to an unexpected
                    problem—he is no longer able to enjoy the thrill of battling and has become quite bored.

                    This all changes with the arrival of Genos, a 19-year-old cyborg, who wishes to be Saitama's
                    disciple after seeing what he is capable of. Genos proposes that the two join the Hero Association
                    in order to become certified heroes that will be recognized for their positive contributions to
                    society, and Saitama, shocked that no one knows who he is, quickly agrees. And thus begins the story
                    of One Punch Man, an action-comedy that follows an eccentric individual who longs to fight strong
                    enemies that can hopefully give him the excitement he once felt and just maybe, he'll become popular
                    in the process.

                    shapeshifting.
                    This leaves the remainder of the world completely powerless, and Izuku Midoriya is one such
                    individual.

                    Since he was a child, the ambitious middle schooler has wanted nothing more than to be a hero.
                    Izuku's
                    unfair fate leaves him admiring heroes and taking notes on them whenever he can. But it seems that
                    his
                    persistence has borne some fruit: Izuku meets the number one hero and his personal idol, All Might.
                    All
                    Might's quirk is a unique ability that can be inherited, and he has chosen Izuku to be his
                    successor!

                    Enduring many months of grueling training, Izuku enrolls in UA High, a prestigious high school
                    famous
                    for its excellent hero training program, and this year's freshmen look especially promising. With
                    his
                    bizarre but talented classmates and the looming threat of a villainous organization, Izuku will soon
                    learn what it really means to be a hero.

                    As a wild youth, elementary school student Shouya Ishida sought to beat boredom in the cruelest
                    ways. When the deaf Shouko Nishimiya transfers into his class, Shouya and the rest of his class
                    thoughtlessly bully her for fun. However, when her mother notifies the school, he is singled out and

                    while teachers turn a blind eye.

                    Now in his third year of high school, Shouya is still plagued by his wrongdoings as a young boy.
                    Sincerely regretting his past actions, he sets out on a journey of redemption: to meet Shouko once

                    American bombings, devastating city after city. Hotaru no Haka, also known as Grave of the

                    ravaged by the brutal war. They have lost their mother, their father, their home, and the prospect
                    of a bright future—all tragic consequences of the war.

                    Now orphaned and homeless, Seita and Setsuko have no choice but to drift across the countryside,
                    beset by starvation and disease. Met with the apathy of adults along the way, they find that
                    desperate circumstances can turn even the kindest of people cruel yet their youthful hope shines
                    brightly in the face of unrelenting hardship, preventing the siblings from swiftly succumbing to an

                    J-pop idol group CHAM! has spent the last two years entertaining its fans. Sadly, all good things
                    must come to an end, and CHAM! must see one of its members, Mima Kirigoe, leave the group to pursue
                    her acting career. While Mima's choice is met with a mixed response, she hopes her fans will
                    continue to support her.

                    However, Mima's life begins to change drastically after her departure from the group. Wanting to
                    shed her pop-idol image, she takes on a role in a crime drama series, and her career as an actress
                    gradually becomes more demanding and taxing for both Mima and her manager, Rumi Hidaka. To add to
                    Mima's growing unease, an obsessed fan who is incapable of accepting that Mima has quit being an
                    innocent idol, begins stalking her; a new anonymous website begins to impersonate her life with
                    intricate detail; and CHAM! also appears to be doing better without her. One by one, each disturbing
                    development drives Mima to become increasingly unhinged and unable to distinguish reality from
                    fantasy.

                    snowfall—both possessing the ability to turn into wolves, a trait inherited from their father. All

                    masked forest spirit named Gin. She learns the hard way that she should not touch the boy, or he
                    would disappear. In spite of this, Gin leads Hotaru out of the forest and warns her never to return
                    when she promises to come again with a gift.

                    Paying no heed to his cautionary words, and despite being separated by both distance and planes of
                    existence, Hotaru and Gin become close friends as she visits him every summer. However, their
                    relationship and resolve are put to the test, when romantic feelings conflict with the one and only
                    rule.

                    Based on Yuki Midorikawa's manga of the same name, Hotarubi no Mori e is a tale of friendship and
                    compromise of two people who should never have crossed paths, as their lives become hopelessly
